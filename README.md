# Corsair 280X Custom lid

This is a replacement for the top lid of Corsair's 280X case, ready to be laser-cut.

The original one has little spacing between the case and the lid, which makes the top slot a suboptimal place for placing exhaust fans. This replacement can be cut on polycarbonate or similar material, and has Monster Hunter themed cut-outs, which not only look rad but also improve airflow.

Original vector drawings for the cut-outs were made by [stage7](http://stg7.net).
